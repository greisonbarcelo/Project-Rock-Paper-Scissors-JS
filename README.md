# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors-JS
Foundations course project from The Odin Project. A rock paper scissors game.
This is a JavaScript project from theOdinProject which I will be 
using to further improve my skills in JS and become a better programmer using what I have learned so far in the Foundation Course of theOdinProject. I am looking forward to completing this website/game and see the results of what I have been studying for the past few weeks.
